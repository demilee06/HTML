    <h1><b>Hobbies</b></h1>

    <h2>Drawing</h2>

    <p><i>I am very fond of drawing in my free time because I have found it to be a great outlet for my creative imagination.</i></p>
    <h2>Cooking</h2>

    <p><i>I love cooking by default because I'm a foodie and trying new recipes has to be one of my favourite things to do with my spare time, not to mention that snacks are a must for me.</i></p>
    <h1><b>Goals</b></h1>

    <h2>Become finacially stable</h2>

    <p><i>I will accomplish this by working hard at the academy , moving on to become an intern and evenutally getting a permanent job where I know I can depend on my salary not only for the basic essentials but to allow myself to live comfortably.</i></p>
    <h2>Become emotionally stable</h2>

    <p><i>During my time here at the academy I will be going to therapy sessions where I will learn more about myself and possibly be able to rewire my thinking in a positive way to suit the lifestyle I want to live.</i></p>
